# Hi, I'm Deivanai Thiyagarajan👋
*(pronounced: DAY-vuh-nye thee-YAH-guh-rah-jun — but “Deiv” works too 😊)*

I'm a Machine Learning & Data Science graduate student with experience spanning  
**ML research, data engineering, and ML-powered systems**.  
I enjoy building **scalable ML pipelines**, working on **RAG-based systems**, and exploring **hardware-aware ML and model efficiency**.
